# Overview
This repository serves as the central hub for all resources, assignments, and contributions throughout this 8-week Rust For Bitcoin program. Participants are expected to complete each task, document their process, and submit their work through a PR to this repository.

The Rust for Bitcoin Program introduces participants to the fundamentals of Bitcoin development while progressively integrating Rust for building, testing, and interacting with Bitcoin’s architecture.

Through hands-on sessions, guided mentorship, and open-source collaboration, participants will:

- Understand Bitcoin fundamentals — blocks, transactions, and the UTXO model
- Learn to run and interact with a Bitcoin node via RPC
- Progress into Rust-based tooling and integration for Bitcoin applications
- Collaborate and contribute to Bitcoin FOSS initiatives
