# Overview
This repository serves as the central hub for all resources, assignments, and contributions throughout this 8-week program.
Participants are expected to complete each task, document their process, and submit their work through a Pull Request (PR) to this repository.

The Rust for Bitcoin Program introduces participants to the fundamentals of Bitcoin development while progressively integrating Rust for building, testing, and interacting with Bitcoin’s architecture.

Through hands-on sessions, guided mentorship, and open-source collaboration, participants will:

- Understand Bitcoin fundamentals — blocks, transactions, and the UTXO model
- Learn to run and interact with a Bitcoin node via RPC
- Progress into Rust-based tooling and integration for Bitcoin applications
- Collaborate and contribute to Bitcoin FOSS initiatives
